# Premise

I got the idea from attending a recent Aphex Twin show and was inspired by the face fold visual. 
I wanted to see what extent I could replicate this visual in realtime.
My initial idea was for the visual to be housed in a desktop app written in C++ and use OpenCV for performance reasons, but I wanted anyone to play with the visual simply by visiting a site, so I switched to a web-based project.

This project used [webpack-starter-basic](https://github.com/lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic) as a starting point.
In-browser face detection is handled by [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js).

# Developing

Some steps 

<a name="install"></a>

## Install

Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helmetroo/phacephold.git 
```

Install required modules.

```bash
npm i
```

## Development

`webpack-dev-server` is used to serve a development build, and enables you to quickly see changes you make from your editor. To start it, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

<a name="preview"></a>

## Preview

`http-server` is used to serve a production build for preview purposes. 
It also allows you to run the app from other devices on your network, say a mobile device connected to the same wireless router.

### SSL Certificate

To preview a production build, you will need to host a root SSL certificate as there is functionality (fetching from your webcam) requiring the build to be served via HTTPS.
You can quickly create a self-signed one for development purposes by running 
```bash 
npm run create-cert
```

You can also follow [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-https-working-on-your-local-development-environment-in-5-minutes-7af615770eec). You will need `openssl` installed to run through the tutorial.
By default, `http-server` will look for a certificate and a private key file. You can change the filenames `http-server` will use for your private key and certificate in `package.json` under `config.https`.

### Run preview server

To preview a production build, run

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Build

To make a production build, run

```bash
npm run build
```
